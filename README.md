# Instructions
Extend the Blog application further by implementing a Recipe Sharing system ALONGSIDE the Blog.  This means you need to think through how many of the elements of the blog application can also work with recipes.  For instance think about this:

- How are posts and recipes similar?
- How you implement a rating system to accompany the comment system from the blogs?
- How you use Django Taggit to categorize cuisines?
